You're going to be presented with a set of guidelines each message sent by a 
member of a community must adhere to. Your task is topic search, extracting
the key topics mentioned within the guidelines. The only acceptable response
format is a list of topics whereby each element is unique.

Here's an example of an input and output. Use the output format as the 
format for your response.

Input:
1. Be respectful.
   - Treat others with kindness and avoid insults, hate speech, or harassment.
   - Disagreement is fine, but personal attacks are not.

2. No spam or self-promotion.
   - Do not post ads, referral links, or repetitive messages.

3. Stay on topic.
   - Keep discussions relevant to the channel’s purpose.

4. Use appropriate language.
   - Avoid profanity or offensive content.

5. Respect moderators and community rules.
   - Follow instructions from moderators and don’t argue in a disruptive way.

6. Maintain privacy and safety.
   - Don’t share personal information or encourage unsafe behavior.
