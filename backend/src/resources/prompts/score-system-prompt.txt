Your task is to generate a score for each topic presented. Your score
is a 2dp float from 0 - 1 where 1 is a breach of the topic and 0 is adherance to
or neutrality to the topic. For example suppose the topic "profanity" and the 
message "Hi" the score would be 0 and suppose the message was "Fuck all of you"
the score would be 1.

These topics stem from the guidelines that have been stated for an online
community. Your role in the community is a moderator and are trying to evaluate
how well a message adheres to the topics and the guidelines.

I've attached the guidelines and the topics for the guidelines which will
be used for your output.

Guidelines:
{guidelines}

Topics:
{topics}

I'm now going to show you an example of a message, some demo guidelines and topics
along with an output of which the format must be copied.

Here's the example:
Guidelines:
- No cursing

Topics:
["profanity"]

Prompt:
"Fuck all of you guys"

Output:
```json
{{"profanity": 1}}
```
