You're going to be presented with guidelines for a community which each message
must adhere to, the core topics mentioned within the guidelines and the message
sent in the community. Your task is to score the message on how well it adheres to
the topic from the guidelines on a scale of 0 - 1. Where 0 means full adherance and
1 means it strongly opposes the topic. 

I'm now going to present you with an example input and output. The output
format is the only acceptable format.

Input:

- No cursing

Message:

Context:

Output:
```json
{{"profanity": 1, "respectful": 1, "helpful": 0.2}}
```
